  NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION ALERT  
==================================================

Detected Traffic Type: Probe Attack

--- Attack Explanation ---

Description:
A Probe attack (or surveillance) involves scanning a network to identify valid IP addresses, open ports, and operating systems.

What is happening:
- Sequential or random connection attempts to multiple ports.
- Mapping of network topology and services.

What to do:
- Block the source IP if scanning is aggressive.
- Review firewall rules to ensure only necessary ports are open.
- Check for subsequent unauthorized access attempts.

What NOT to do:
- Do not expose sensitive services to the public internet unnecessarily.
